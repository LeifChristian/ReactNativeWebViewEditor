# ReactNativeWebViewEditor
React Native Expo - Mobile App Wrapper for my React File Manager/Text Editor
Simple Expo App which contains a Webview of my React File Manager/Text Editor build, and a refresh button.

This build will work to serve any website as a React Native app. Additional functionality could include navigation, but we should probs just use Chrome at that point.

git clone
expo install
expo start

Cheers!
